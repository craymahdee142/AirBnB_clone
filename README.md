0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

# Description

The console is the first segment of the "AirBnB ALX SE project"
that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming.
The goal of "AirBnB project" is to eventually deploy our server a
simple copy of the "AirBnB Website(HBnB)".
A command interpreter is created in this segment to
manage objects for the "AirBnB(HBnB) website"

This is the first step towards building our first full
web application: the AirBnB clone.
